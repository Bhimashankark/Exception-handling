    "answer : In Python, an Exception is a runtime error that occurs when the code encounters an unexpected condition or situation that it cannot handle. It is a way of notifying the programmer that something has gone wrong during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are objects that contain information about the error that occurred, including a description of the problem and the location in the code where the error occurred. When an exception occurs, Python stops executing the current code block and looks for an exception handler that can handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code. Syntax errors are caused by mistakes such as misspelled keywords, missing colons or parentheses, or incorrect indentation. Unlike exceptions, syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is run, and they prevent the code from executing at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between Exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Syntax errors occur during the compilation of the code, whereas Exceptions occur during the execution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause: Syntax errors are caused by invalid code, while Exceptions are caused by unexpected situations that the code encounters at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors cannot be handled by the program, and they must be fixed before the code can be executed. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be handled by the program using exception handling techniques such as try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Syntax errors prevent the program from executing, while Exceptions do not necessarily stop the program from running, but they can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash if they are not handled properly."

    "In this example, we define a custom exception class called MyCustomException that inherits from the base Exception class. The constructor of this class takes a message as an argument and sets it as an instance variable message. We call the constructor of the parent class Exception with the message argument using super().__init__(self.message).\n",
